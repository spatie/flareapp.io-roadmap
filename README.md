# Roadmap and Home of Feature Requests

We've got a lot of good ideas to keep pushing Flare to be the best error tracker for Laravel it can be and we're sure that you've got some ideas too. Feel free to open a discussion with any suggestion or feature request you can think of. Adding reactions to exisiting feature requests helps us triage good ideas and choose features we'll all enjoy in the future!

Here for the road trip? We keep track of features we're working on by labeling them in [the discussions section of this repo](https://github.com/spatie/flareapp.io-roadmap/discussions?discussions_q=label%3A%22in+progress%22).

# About Flare

Flare is a Laravel-tailored exception tracker that helps you spend more time fixing bugs and less time uncovering them. Over at Spatie we built Flare with the same amount of care and attention we put into the hundreds of open source packages we maintain. It's the exception tracker that we always wanted.
